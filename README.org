* Universal Android Debloater

- A great utility to debloat apps in android using ~adb~.
- It gives a safe list to remove like google stuffs.

I have the latest binary of this in repo, please do check and download latest one from their github release tags.

* Shell.nix

[[file:shell.nix][Shell.nix]] is a nix file for ~UAD~ to work. UAD binary does not work under nixos, as nix violates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_file_system][FHS]].

- Just run this command in this directory.
  #+begin_src sh
nix-shell
  #+end_src

- You can now run ~UAD~ with ~./uad_gui-linux~

* Realme Debloat Bash Script

- This would be easier method without needing ~UAD~.
- You need to know/get the packages names (eg: =com.android.fmradio=)
- This only requires ~adb~ and your terminal (shell).

  I have forked this from [[https://github.com/realKarthikNair/realme-ui-debloater]]

Although Installing a Custom rom would be a better choice, it comes with its own cons and need to be very careful, if not say bye to your phone ;-)
